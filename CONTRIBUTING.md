# Contributing Guidelines

**Do** follow [the seven rules of a great Git commit message][1].

**Do** follow [the Clojure Style Guide][2].

**Do** include tests for your change when appropriate.

**Do** ensure that the CI checks pass.

**Do** squash the commits in your PR to remove corrections
irrelevant to the code history, once the PR has been reviewed.

**Don't** overuse vertical whitespace; avoid multiple sequential blank
lines.

**Don't** include more than one feature or fix in a single PR.

**Don't** include changes unrelated to the purpose of the PR. This
includes changing the project version number, adding lines to the
`.gitignore` file, or changing the indentation or formatting.

**Don't** open a new PR if changes are requested. Just push to the
same branch and the PR will be updated.

**Do** sign the Contributor License Agreement.

You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) ([for individuals][3],
[for corporations][4])before your pull request will be merged.
This a one-time requirement for contributing to each Magnet's open
source project. You can read more about [Contributor License Agreements
(CLA) on Wikipedia][5].

Signing the CLA doesn't have to be done up-front, it is only
required for your pull request to be merged. You can clone,
fork, and submit your pull request as usual.
